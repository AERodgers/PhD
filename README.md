### TO DO

* ~~Update OR LMEs to extract ANOVA tables and statistics for 2-level factor statistics.~~
* ~~Update post-hoc p.value script so it can:~~
  ~~1. Extract a list of p.values from tables even if they do not follow the same table structure~~
  ~~2. Insert p.adj back into the appropriate table AFTER p.value~~
  ~~3. Overwrite previous p.adj columns using the same p.adj method~~
  ~~4. Remove any previous signif. columns and insert a new one as a last column.~~

    $\rightarrow$ Alternative solution: getModelFixedFX now automatically distinguishes two-level factors from multilevel factors and adds the slope statistics of the two-level factros them to the pairwise analysis. Also, p values of ANOVAs of models need to be assessed separately as they already incorporate statistics and p.values from the terns in the model.
